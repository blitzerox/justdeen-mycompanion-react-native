Could not find a shared URI scheme for the dev client between the local /ios and /android directories. App launches (QR code, interstitial, terminal keys) may not work as expected. You can configure a custom scheme using the --scheme option, or by running npx expo prebuild to regenerate the native directories with URI schemes.
